    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <h3>Why I Built This</h3>

    <p>
      This is the first paragraph introducing the webpage. It's a simple project
      to practice HTML basics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragraph two adds some more details about the purpose of this webpage and
      what I hope to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third paragraph talks about the technologies Iâ€™m learning, such as
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the fourth paragraph encourages visitors to explore and learn
      alongside me.
